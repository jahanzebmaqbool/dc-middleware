dc-middleware
=============

This is a middleware implementation for volunteer distributed computing. It was done as a class project for the course of Distribtued Computing during my undergraduate studies at NUST.

It might not be the perfect implementation, however, the purpose was to implement a basic middleware application that supports volunter computing coupled with HPC to solve some computation problems. 

Master/Worker paradigms was used where worker were the volunteer nodes while Master was responsible for the worker registration, job distribtued, result aggregation, load balancing, and synchronization.
